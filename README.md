1 I'm Patrick Herring aka anweald, in Leeds, UK
2 javascript jquery libraries for a web app
3 see 2
4 none I'm afraid
5 ph@anweald.co.uk
4.1 in the last few years my eyesight has gone not good. So reading this is not obviously easy.
4.2 I was using jquery-.7.1 and jquery-UI (both min.js versions) but now I'metting weird errors like odd Math bugs and code that just doesn't work anymore e.g. loop code that doesn't 
stop so I hope some kind person can tell me the jquery changes for the last 10 years so I can catch up. The last screen I saw said something like sri integrity hashes, 
which I don't understand at all. I think I've put all this in a README, which is not much diff from shouting, sorry...
